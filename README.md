# 🧰 Drag and Drop Frontend Development Project

This project is a **no-framework, pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript website builder** that lets users **drag elements like Text, Images, and Buttons** into a customizable canvas and then **edit their properties** in real-time via a live editor panel.

It's ideal for learning DOM manipulation, drag-and-drop APIs, and responsive UI design—perfect for internships, portfolio building, or frontend interviews.
